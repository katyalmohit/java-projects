#Password and Notes Manager:
This project consists of password and notes manager which is built on JAVA language. It is a GUI based application. 
To use this application, simply download all these files or fork this repository.
After proper setup, run the file-"Login.java".
After running it, click on login button.
Initially the username is "user@gmail.com" and password is "password".
Now, click login and hurray! you have done it.
You can check out various options.
You can generate a password of any length, perform encryption and decryption.
For encryption and decryption I have used 'AES (Advance Encryption Standard)' and 'SHA-1' for hashing.
If you want to save credentials of your accounts in your own database, just click "Add credentials"
After adding, if you want to see the stored information just click "Search Credentials".
These credentials are stored in a file with the help of file handling in java.
While saving the credentials I have ensured that the password is stored in an encrypted form, which can also be verified by user by checking "account_details.txt".
For notes manager, I have used file handling.
